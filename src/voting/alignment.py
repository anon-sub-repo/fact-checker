Given the following factual claim, bill summary, and vote on the bill, evaluate whether the content of the bill summary and the voting record align with the given claim. You may consider factors such as the main objectives of the bill and unintended or implicit consequences. Your task is to determine if the information provided in the bill summary and the voting record supports or refutes the given factual claim. Return your explanation and one of the following labels in JSON format.
Bill Summary:
{summary}
Vote: {vote_type}
Claim: {claim}
Labels:
Supports - The vote on this bill directly or indirectly supports the claim.
Refutes - The vote on this bill explicitly refutes the claim.
Inconclusive - The vote on this bill does not provide enough information to support or refute the claim.
Irrelevant - The vote on this bill is not relevant to the claim at all.
